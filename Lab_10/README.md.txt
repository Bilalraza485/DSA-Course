## Problem 1: Symmetric Tree
**LeetCode Problem:** [Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=tree)

### Problem Description:
Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

### Solution:
The solution uses a recursive approach to check if the left subtree is a mirror of the right subtree.

### Explanation:
You can view the explanation of the solution [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mao9uzxwvmc).

## Problem 2: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
**LeetCode Problem:** [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=tree)

### Problem Description:
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

### Solution:
This problem can be solved by using a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the height of the tree.

## Problem 3: Path Sum
**LeetCode Problem:** [Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=tree)

### Problem Description:
Given a binary tree and a target sum, return true if there is a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the target sum.

### Solution:
This is solved by recursively traversing the tree and subtracting the node value from the target sum until a leaf is reached.

## Problem 4: Invert Binary Tree
**LeetCode Problem:** [Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=tree)

### Problem Description:
Invert a binary tree.

### Solution:
This problem is solved by swapping the left and right child nodes of each node in the tree recursively.

---

## Problem 5: Path Sum II
**LeetCode Problem:** [Path Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=binary-tree)

### Problem Description:
Given the root of a binary tree and a target sum, return all root-to-leaf paths where each pathâ€™s sum equals the target sum.

### Solution:
A depth-first search (DFS) approach is used to find all paths that sum up to the target value.
